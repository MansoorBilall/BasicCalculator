# Simple Calculator in Python

This Python script is a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user inputs two numbers and selects an operation to be performed.

## Features

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher (for `match` statement compatibility)

## How to Run

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:  
   Download the script or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Script Location**:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script by typing the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py

4. **Follow the Prompts**:
   Enter the first number when prompted.
   Enter the second number when prompted.
   Enter the operation (+, -, *, or /) when prompted.

5. **View the Result**:
   The result of the calculation will be displayed on the screen.

## Example
    
  Enter first number: 10
  Enter second number: 5
  Enter operation (+, -, *, /): *
  Result: 50.0


## Prompt Example

  Result: 5.0  

## Notes
 *Ensure that you have Python 3.10 or higher installed, as the script uses the match statement introduced in Python 3.10.
 *The script handles basic arithmetic operations. For more advanced features, consider modifying or expanding the code.
